# metacrud

## What is this?
This is a REACT NODE web application where I try to explore the limits of reusable components featuring a CRUD system.
The quid of this project is to use javascript schemes prototypes to automate forms and validate data.

## Why I do this?

Any kind of web app can be uderstood as a CRUD system. This entails the possibility of a lot of duplicate code.

So I propposed my self the challenge of creating reusables components for all these operations with no regards of the type of entity within a system. 

## What do I proppose here?

An UI to create schemas, with wich create then entities and interact with them. 

## Why "metacrud"?

From the greek term META ("beyond"), and CRUD, for such type of operations, metacrud intents to resume in reusable components the features involved in this procesess beyond the type of entity. 

## Wich stack I used?
Front: 
- React
- Axios
- Redux

Backend:
- Node JS
- File System API
